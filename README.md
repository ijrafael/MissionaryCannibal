# Missionary Cannibal Problem

## How to Run
Please make sure to have Python 3.10 or later installed

Run the misscannibals.py file to solve the [Missionary Cannibal problem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem). You can change the amount of starting missionaries or cannibals and it will always start on the left side. It will output the moves that the user should do to move the missionaries and cannibals from one side to another. This uses a depth first graph search and breadth first graph search to solve the problem.

This was made in CPSC481 - Artificial Intelligence.
